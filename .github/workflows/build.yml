# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: build

# 在哪个行为下执行
on:
  # 在push或pull请求事件上触发工作流，但只针对主分支
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

  # 允许您从“操作”选项卡手动运行此工作流
  workflow_dispatch:

#工作流运行由一个或多个作业组成，这些作业可以按顺序或并行运行
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    #  运行的机器类型
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
